# Guides

A dual-axis index into this repository's guides — by concept, and by directory.

## By concept

| Concept | Spec                 | Source                    | Tests                                 |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Form    | [`form.md`](form.md) | [`src/core`](../src/core) | [`tests/src/core`](../tests/src/core) |

## By directory

| Directory  | Guide                |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| `src/core` | [`form.md`](form.md) |

The parity suite transcribes and executes the flagship fence set from `form.md`. It name-checks and
parity-checks the remaining fences but does not run them.

## Dependency reference

[`guide.md`](guide.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for `@orkestrel/guide` — the
devDependency powering this repository's guides-parity suite
([`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts)). It documents **that package's** surface — the
`Guide` and `Source` projections plus the manifest and comparison helpers — not anything sourced
here. It is kept beside this guide set so a reader of the parity suite can see the primitives it is
built from without leaving it.

[`scaffold.md`](scaffold.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for `@orkestrel/scaffold` — the
devDependency that generates and repairs this workspace's vendored configuration, tests, and
tooling. It documents **that package's** surface, not anything sourced here, and it is kept for the
same reason.

A mirror's own relative links address its upstream tree, so they resolve to nothing here and sit
outside this repository's link parity. Refresh a mirror from upstream rather than rewriting it.
